                            List Llama is a grocery list Web App created by Anders Long, Chase Prochnow, Natalie Ruckman and Trevor Ives for UNL's Fall 2020 CSCE 361 Class.
                            The web app was created using the asp.net technology stack, SQL and Azure to build, store and host the project. I worked mostly on the backend except for
                            several times where I implemented small features to the ui. You can take a look at 
                            <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/theme/grayscale/">the project repo</a>
                            to see all the hardwork Group 5 and I put into our project!

                            <h4>Grocery Item Engine</h4>
                            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Once the controller and accessor had been created for the grocery item model I was tasked 
                            with creating the engine. The engine is used in MVC archetichure to seperate the logic performed from the ui. The engine uses the methods 
                            found in the accessor to create seperation between the controller and the accessor. The grocery item controller calls the grocery 
                            item engine to use the methods that are located in grocery item accessor. This also provides an example of the Open Closed Principle 
                            where the controller uses the engine as an extension of the accessor so nothing can be changed or modified. You can see many of the methods in
                            the engine are similiar to the accessor functions, but a little more descriptive. This helps define the methods better so its easier to tell which
                            method youre using in the controllers when implementing the engine. I also was in charge of creating the interfaces for the engines (more on that later),
                            but at the top of the engine you can see I also implemented the interface to provide dependency. You can download a copy of the Item engine <a href="assets/files/GroceryItemEngine.cs">here</a>.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">Because the interfaces are relatvilely small I am going to include the both the list 
                                    and item engine interfaces, and the list and item accessor interfaces as one code piece. After creating the Engines I went ahead and created both the item and list interfaces 
                                    to go with their respective engines to provide more abstraction and seperation between the front end and back end while also 
                                    providing more modularity. This allows the devlopers to change something in the project without having it conflict with other
                                     parts of the project.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">In the examples youn can see that the interfaces just include the declaration of the methods 
                                    and their parameters from the engines. On the right is actually an example of the Grocery item accessor interface which helps 
                                    provide abstraction and seperetion from the accessor when its getting called by the engines. I felt that overall the interfaces were 
                                    easy to make and only deserved to be listed as 1 code piece. Below you can find the several interfaces I created.</p>
